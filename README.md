## Sydney Airbnb Pricing Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting the prices of Airbnb listings in Sydney, Australia. By employing machine learning techniques, we aim to develop accurate models that can assist both hosts in setting competitive prices for their listings and travelers in making informed decisions.
Overview:

The Airbnb platform offers a diverse range of accommodations, from shared rooms to entire apartments, making it challenging for hosts to determine optimal pricing. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging various features of Airbnb listings, such as property type, location, amenities, and reviews, to predict listing prices accurately.
Key Steps:

    Data Collection and Exploration: We collect data from Airbnb listings in Sydney and explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and relationships. We analyze correlations between different variables and identify patterns that may influence pricing.

    Data Preprocessing: We preprocess the raw data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and extracting relevant features from the listing names, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and beds. Additionally, we create binary columns to represent different room types (private room, shared room, hotel room, entire home/apartment).

    Model Training and Evaluation: We train several machine learning models, including linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and random forests, to predict listing prices. We evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.

    Model Selection and Deployment: Based on the evaluation results, we select the best-performing model(s) and deploy them for practical use. This deployment may involve integrating the model into a web application, API, or other platforms to provide pricing predictions in real-time.
